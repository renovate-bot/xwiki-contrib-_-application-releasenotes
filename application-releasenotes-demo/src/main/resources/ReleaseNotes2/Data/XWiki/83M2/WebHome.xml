== General Notes ==

When upgrading make sure you compare your ##xwiki.cfg##, ##xwiki.properties## and ##web.xml## files with the newest version since some configuration parameters may have been modified or added. Note that you should add ##xwiki.store.migration=1## so that XWiki will attempt to automatically migrate your current database to the new schema. Make sure you backup your Database before doing anything.
