This is the release notes for [[XWiki Commons&gt;&gt;http://commons.xwiki.org]], [[XWiki Rendering&gt;&gt;http://rendering.xwiki.org]], [[XWiki Platform&gt;&gt;http://platform.xwiki.org]] and [[XWiki Enterprise&gt;&gt;http://enterprise.xwiki.org]]. They share the same release notes as they are released together and have the same version.

This release brings mostly usability improvements:

* You now have the ability to export children pages along with the current one in XAR and HTML formats. 
* Ratings and active install numbers are now displayed in the Livetable on the home page of the Extension Repository Application. 
* You can easily use a color theme from the main wiki in other subwikis.
* New hints are displayed in the user profile preferences. 
* Some page suggestions are displayed when you try to reach a page or an attachment that do not exist.

In addition, more than 35 bugs have been fixed!

=== Moved Modules ==

* Cache module has been moved to XWiki Commons. This mostly means that you can now use it in commons and rendering modules. Nothing change in the classes or packages names, just need to update group id and artifact id in your build tool.
* Application Manager moved to Contrib (https://github.com/xwiki-contrib/xwiki-platform-application-manager), it can still be installed as extension if required

=== Upgrades ===

The following dependencies have been upgraded:

* [[Jackson 2.8.1&gt;&gt;http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XCOMMONS-1015]]
* [[cssparser 0.9.20&gt;&gt;http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XCOMMONS-1024]]
* [[Infinispan 8.2.4&gt;&gt;http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XCOMMONS-1046]]
* [[JSON-Java 20160810&gt;&gt;http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XCOMMONS-1045]]
* [[Bouncy Castle 1.55&gt;&gt;http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XCOMMONS-1049]]

= Known issues =

* [[Bugs we know about&gt;&gt;http://jira.xwiki.org/secure/IssueNavigator.jspa?reset=true&amp;jqlQuery=category+%3D+%22Top+Level+Projects%22+AND+issuetype+%3D+Bug+AND+resolution+%3D+Unresolved+ORDER+BY+updated+DESC]]

= Backward Compatibility and Migration Notes =

== General Notes ==

When upgrading make sure you compare your ##xwiki.cfg##, ##xwiki.properties## and ##web.xml## files with the newest version since some configuration parameters may have been modified or added. Note that you should add ##xwiki.store.migration=1## so that XWiki will attempt to automatically migrate your current database to the new schema. Make sure you backup your Database before doing anything.

== Issues specific to XWiki 8.3 Milestone 1 ==

=== LDAP Module moved to Contrib ===

The module containing among other things the standard LDAP authenticator has been moved to http://github.com/xwiki-contrib/ldap and is not embedded anymore in XE. Starting with 8.3M1 you need to install it if you want to use it. See http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/LDAP/#H8.3.x for more details on what between the XWiki Platform module and the new Contrib Extension.

=== Cache module moved to XWiki Commons ===

The only thing that changed is the id of the modules. If you have any dependency on those you just need to change ##org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-platform-*## to ##org.xwiki.commons:xwiki-commons-*##

== API Breakages ==

No API has been broken since XWiki 8.2.1!
